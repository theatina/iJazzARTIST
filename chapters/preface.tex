The thesis at hand is based on a collaborative project developed by the research team I had been part of, during my internship at ``Athena" Research Center. 

The research questions were initially formulated by Maximos Kaliakatsos-Papakostas, the project manager, and further developed by both Maximos and Kosmas Kritsis. The data processing, system design and implementation, as well as the experiments and results analysis, were a product of teamwork between Maximos, Kosmas and me. 

I would like to express my deep gratitude to my colleagues, Maximos and Kosmas for the wonderful cooperation and excellent guidance that I was given during the project and Maximos for his significant supervision of my thesis. I would also like to thank Vasilis Katsouros and Ioannis Ioannidis for their essential support during the overall process.
